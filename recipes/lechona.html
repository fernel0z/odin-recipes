          <h2>History</h2>
           <p>Lechonería has ancient roots that date back to the early stages of pig domestication. This culinary art did not originate in Colombia, but its beginnings can be traced to the ancient Middle East and Arab traditions. The social and religious rituals of these peoples connected humanity, deities, and communities through food as an offering.</p>
           <p>The legacy of these pork-based preparations arrived in America with the Spanish during the conquest and colonization processes. In Spanish cuisine, pork has always played a central role, transforming ancient Arab recipes before reaching American lands.</p>
           <p>In Latin America, the heritage of pork-based preparations brought with it a diversification of flavors and culinary techniques. Each country adapted the recipe to its own tastes and local ingredients, while maintaining the essence of stuffing the pig with meats and other ingredients.</p>
           <p>In Colombia, lechona became consolidated in the central region, prepared for both aristocrats and common people during religious and family celebrations. This culinary tradition became especially rooted in the departments of Tolima and Huila, giving rise to "Lechona Tolimense."</p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>2 white onions (160g)</li>
            <li>2 stalks of green onion, including the green part (30g)</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded (160g)</li>
            <li>1 kilogram of pork, thinly sliced (1000g)</li>
            <li>2 packets of maggi rib broth, crumbled (18g)</li>
            <li>1 pork cushion (3 kilograms)</li>
            <li>2 pounds of cooked rice (1000g)</li>
            <li>1 pound of cooked yellow peas</li>
            <li>juice of 2 lemons</li>
           </ul>
    
          <h2>preparation</h2> 
           <ol>
            <li>In a blender, place the white onion, green onion, and bell pepper, and blend. Put the meat in a bowl, pour the blended mixture over it, and mix well. Finally, add the crumbled MAGGI rib broth packet, massaging the meat thoroughly until it is well coated</li>
            <li>Place the pork skin in a baking dish or oven-safe tray.</li>
            <li>Fill with a layer of rice, followed by a layer of meat, then the peas, another layer of meat, and finish with another layer of rice.</li>
            <li>With a knife, make small holes spaced apart along the edges. Using a large needle and twine, carefully sew through the holes to close tightly. Place the cushion in the dish with the seams facing down.</li>
            <li>Coat the pork skin with lemon juice and the other crumbled MAGGI rib broth packet, massaging it well to ensure even coverage. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Uncover the dish by removing the aluminum foil, increase the temperature to 200°C (392°F), and continue baking for another 2 hours until the skin is golden and crispy.</li>
           </ol>
